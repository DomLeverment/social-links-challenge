## My process
- Started with the html 
- built out the css 
- used ChatGPT for debug on hover issues for css

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ChatGPT

### Continued development

Starting to get the hang out of these types of challenges, so looking forward to moving onto the next one. Still need some help with transitions and had a little bit of trouble with changing the text-color on hover.
